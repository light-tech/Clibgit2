# Clibgit2

This repository is to provide a module `Clibgit2` as a Swift package (via XCFramework) so that it could be added as dependency for [SwiftGit2](https://github.com/light-tech/SwiftGit2).

The XCFramework was actually built using scripts in [another project](https://github.com/light-tech/LibGit2-On-iOS).
